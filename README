# MUD

This is the code for a mud, written in Ruby. Persistant data is stored with activerecord, and almost everything is interacted with through a model of some sort.

## Running the game

Just `ruby mud.rb` - this will spawn the main eventmachine loop.

## Editing data

Built on a rails app, so you can use `bundle exec rails c production` to work with the production database

## Extending functionality

TODO
